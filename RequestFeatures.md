# Preface

Feature requests are [managed using the Bitbucket Issue page](https://bitbucket.org/maproom/qmapshack/issues?status=new&status=open).

Keep in mind that you are asking a stranger to spend time/work for you - stay kind and try to support him/her as good as you can.

# Things to include in your request

2. Sketch in detail how you think the feature should be integrated into the GUI or the workflow.
3. If possible, **provide ressources** (such as icons) required while implementing your feature

**Do not assign an issue to anyone!** The issue will be assigned when someone volunteers to solve it.

If you want someone else to do the work for you open an [Issue](https://bitbucket.org/maproom/qmapshack/issues?status=new&status=open). Do not assign it to anyone. If someone volunteers to implement it the issue will be assigned. To increase your chances consider the following:
