# Using Offline Documentation

The online _QMapShack_ documentation (which you are probably just reading)
is also available as offline documentation in the `doc/` sub-directory
of the source code distribution or as a _Mercurial_ repository.  If you
have _Mercurial_ installed, you can clone the _QMapShack_ wiki by issuing
the command

        hg clone https://bitbucket.org/maproom/qmapshack/wiki QMapShack-doc

Both, the source code distribution's `doc/` sub-directory and the
_Mercurial_ repository contain _Markdown_ (`*.md`) files, and to read
them you will either need some _Markdown_ plugin for your browser or
you'll need to create `*.html` input files for your browser from the
`*.md` files as described below.

## Prerequisites

To create the `*.html` files from the corresponding `*.md` files you
will need:

* _Python_ 2.7 or better.

* _Python_'s _Markdown_ module version 2.6.6 or better plus the
  following standard _Markdown_ extensions:

     * _Abbreviations_[^1]
     * _Definition Lists_[^1]
     * _Fenced Code Blocks_[^1]
     * _Footnotes_[^1]
     * _Sane Lists_
     * _Table of Contents_
     * _Tables_[^1]
     * _WikiLinks_

    _Markdown_ as well as its aforementioned extensions are for instance
    downloadable [here](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/).

* _GNU_ `make`.  The makefile provided for maintaining the offline
  documentation uses "simply expanded variables" (defined via "`::=`",
  as introduced by the Posix standard in 2012)[^2]

[^1]: These extensions are sub-extensions included in _Python_'s
_Markdown_ _Extra_ extension.  Since these are the only sub-extensions
of the _Extra_ extension which are supported by the Bitbucket server,
these are also the only extensions of the _Extra_ extension used by the
conversion script.

[^2]: If your version of `make` can't handle "`::=`" and you can't find
or install another one, simply replace all occurrences of "`::=`" in file
`Makefile` in the documentation directory with "`=`".  In this makefile
using "simply expanded variables" (defined via the "`::=`" assignment)
rather than "recursively expanded variables" (defined via the normal
"`=`" assignment) is just a matter of efficiency: referencing variables
assigned with "`::=`" will burn less CPU cycles but in the case at hand
will not produce different results in any way ("`::=`" is the type of
variable assignment we are used from normal programming languages, while
"`=`" behaves more like a function definition).

## Building the `*.html` files

Change into the `doc/` directory containing the offline documentation
and issue the commands

>    make doc  
>    _YourBrowser_ DocMain.html

This will create any new and update all outdated `*.html` files before
it opens your browser at the main documentation page.  If you plan to
frequently reference the offline documentation, you might consider
creating a command alias from the last command line above by executing

>    alias qms-doc='_YourBrowser_ /_absolute_/_path_/_to_/doc/DocMain.html'[^3]

[^3]:
    Under _Cygwin_ you should instead use

    >    alias qms-doc='(cd /_absolute_/_path_/_to_/doc ; _YourBrowser_ DocMain.html ; )'

    because in that case the argument passed to your browser must be
    interpretable as a Windows path.
