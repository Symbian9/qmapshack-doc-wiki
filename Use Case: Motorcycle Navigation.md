# Peculiarities of Motorcycle navigation #

As it appears, motorcycle navigation has something special, so that all those major manufacturers of navigation devices even offer special prouduct series. Beyond ruggedized design and glove optimized handling, mathere are special features like navigating along tracks, preference for curvy roads or skipping of intermediary route points.

**They way is the goal**. This implies special requirements for trip planning, which obviously not be present in this combination in other GIS related situations:

* extensive share of trip data with third parties (friends, other planning tools, web hosted trips)
* maps with indication of "scenicness"
* repeated replanning of trips already engaged
* fast replanning while driving
* ....

For sake of example let me report some encounters of my last tour I pre-planned with QMapShack and engaged with the route downloaded to a Garmin zumo 390LM:

Some supplemental waypoints I added to "nail down" a route to my desires where some dozen meters beneath the road. If you realize it during driving, you have to pass it by and then manually call "skip route point" to avoid your navi insisting on "turn". Not nice during driving curvy roads. If you do not realize it, you enter some residential area or some higway junction just be told that you can turn now: Have been there, have done that. So, carefully adjusting your "trip nails" is tantamount.

* One road that was both included by QMapShack backend routino and by Garmins nüvi I found decorated by the infamous "closed for cars and motorcycles". Pretending to be nice guy, I passed by and fund myself on a Highway that led me to miss one of the most interesting pieces of the journey I planned. Presumably there hat been an alternative to my sceny track, but you won't find that in heavy traffic when you are just entering a higwhay, unprotected between 40-ton-trucks. Nice reason to ride there again :-) . After the trip is before the trip. 

* On another junction, my eyes found a sideway that promised an even more sceny trip than the one that I had planned before. Great - just turne and enjoy the nüvis functionality to reroute me back to my preplanned tour on other curvy roads. This nice deviation is registered in my track log and avialable for future planning.
