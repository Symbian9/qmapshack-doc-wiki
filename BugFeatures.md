# Bugs & Features

There is an issue tracker, that can be used for that kind of stuff. It's open to anonymous access. However if you register to BitBucket you will be informed when ever there is a change of your topic. Sometimes I will ask for more information. If you miss these questions and there is **no feedback in a reasonable time**, I will **delete the request** without further attention.

**Do not assign an issue to anyone!** The issue will be assigned when someone volunteers to solve it. 

## Bugs

If you have found a bug file a bug report on the [Issues](https://bitbucket.org/maproom/qmapshack/issues?status=new&status=open) page. 

1. **Consider fixing it yourself.** For example bad spelling, confusing names or explanations and bad translations can be fixed by everyone. Use Qt5 Linguist to edit the translations. Linguist will tell you the source file containing the string, too. By that you can change the original string in the source code. 

Please make sure to provide:

2. Information about the **operating system and the software's version**. You find this in the menu "?" -> About
3. Give a **detailed report** about what is broken
4. Give instructions about **how to reproduce** the problem
5. If **additional data** is needed give **real links** to that data. A mellow description where to find it is not sufficient.

All bugs will get some attention. Due to vacations this might take up to 2 weeks. If there is no answer after that period make yourself heard via email.

## Features

Your **best chance** to get a new feature is to** implement it on your own**. If you want someone else to do the work for you open an [Issue](https://bitbucket.org/maproom/qmapshack/issues?status=new&status=open). Do not assign it to anyone. If someone volunteers to implement it the issue will be assigned. To increase your chances consider the following:

1. Give a detailed description of what you want and why you think it's of a general interest. Just because software XYZ does it, is a bad reason. 
2. Sketch in detail how you think the feature should be integrated into the GUI or the workflow. 
3. If your request requires eye candy like icons, make a suggestion how the icons should look like or provide the icons as SVG. If you want certain colors, name them and give a reason for your choice. 

It's ok if you do not know how to code C++. But always keep in mind you ask someone to spend his/her time for you. Thus try to prepare  as much as possible the stuff that does not need programming skills. And if someone implemented a feature for you it would be more than fair of you to test it faithfully and to add a nice documentation about it in the Wiki.
