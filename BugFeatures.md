# Bugs & Features

## Bugs

If you have found a bug file a bug report on the [Issues](https://bitbucket.org/maproom/qmapshack/issues?status=new&status=open) page. Please make sure to provide:

1. Information about the operating system and the software's version. You find this in the menu "?" -> About
2. Give a detailed report about what is broken
3. Give instructions about how to reproduce the problem
4. If additional data is needed give real links to that data. A mellow description where to find it is not sufficient.

All bugs will get some attention. Due to vacations this might take up to 2 weeks. If there is no answer after that period make yourself heard via email.

##Features

Your best chance to get a new feature is to implement it on your own. If you want someone else to do the work for you open an [Issue](https://bitbucket.org/maproom/qmapshack/issues?status=new&status=open). Do not assign it to anyone. If someone volunteers to implement it the issue will be assigned. To increase your chances consider the following:

1. Give a detailed description of what you want and why you think it's of a general interest. Just because software XYZ does it, is a bad reason. 
2. Sketch in detail how you think the feature should be integrated into the GUI or the workflow. 
3. If your request requires eye candy like icons, make a suggestion how the icons should look like or provide the icons as SVG. If you want certain colors, name them and give a reason for your choice. 

It's ok if you do not know how to code C++. But always keep in mind you ask someone to spend his/her time for you. Thus try to prepare  as much as possible the stuff that does not need programming skills. And if someone implemented a feature for you it would be more than fair of you to test it faithfully and to add a nice documentation about it in the Wiki.
