# Waypoints

A waypoint is a coordinate with data attached. This can be a point of interest, a geocache or a georeferenced image. If you move the mouse close enough to a waypoint it gets highlighted by a red circle:

## Move Waypoint

![WptMove.png](images/DocGisItemsWpt/WptMove.png) When moving the waypoint the cursor will be locked to move mode. On a right mouse button click the move action is aborted. On a left mouse button click the waypoint is dropped at the new position. If the cursor is close to the viewport's border, the map is moved.

## Project Waypoint

![WptProj.png](images/DocGisItemsWpt/WptProj.png) Different to moving the waypoint this will create a clone of the waypoint. You have to give an explicit distance and bearing the waypoint is moved. You might want to change the icon and the name.
