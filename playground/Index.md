When compiling an index, the main advantages of definition lists over
tables in my eyes are

    * Table widths are determined using the longest items having to be
      listed, whereas in definition lists the main index entry is kept
      on a separate line while the sub-index entries are indented.

    * When using tables, all sub-indices of a single main index entry
      have to be kept in a single line, if you want them to be displayed
      in a row rather than in a column.  This makes automatic sorting of
      sub-indices more or less impossible.  In contrast, using
      definition tables results in an easy to maintain "*.md" file.

And apart from using longer and more informative link texts I would also
use link titles (as done in a few of the topmost index lines above)
which should be still a bit more informative than the plain link texts.
