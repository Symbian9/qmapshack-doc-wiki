# Edit items with multiple points (tracks, routes, areas)

The coordinates of items containing a polyline or polygon can be edited by switching the mouse cursor into _Line Edit Mode_. If you click on an item's point you find a tool button to do so.

## Line Edit Mode

In _Line Edit Mode_ a magenta line overlays the item. The item's points are marked by small bullets.

You will notice that you can't move the map by point-click-drag anymore. The map will move automatically if the mouse gets close to the screen borders. The arrow keys on the keyboard will still work. To zoom use the mouse wheel or the + and - key.

## Accept changes permanently

All changes will be just temporarily until you choose to apply them permanently. In _Line Edit Mode_ three buttons appear in the top left corner of the map canvas. Use the _Abort_ button to leave the line edit mode without any change to the original data. If you _Save to original_ the coordinate data will be written back, but all other data like timestamps will be lost. If you do not like this choose _Save as new_.
