# Edit items with multiple points (tracks, routes, areas)

![maproom2](images/DocGisItemsEditMultiple/AreaMove.png) ![maproom2](images/DocGisItemsEditMultiple/LineMove.png) To edit the line of those items you have to switch into line edit mode. This will create a copy of the line. The copy can be changed and changes have to be saved to the original item or new item is created. Please be aware that especially for tracks additional data like timestamps and elevation will be lost when saving the changed line to the original item.

In line edit mode several buttons are displayed on-screen.
