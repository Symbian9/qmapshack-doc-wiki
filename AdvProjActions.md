# Working with projects

## Merge projects

**Source:** [gmane.comp.gis.qlandkartegt](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gis.qlandkartegt.user/2612)

With QMapShack version 1.6.1 or later:

  * Load all stuff you want to have in a single project into the workspace (possibly resulting in several new projects).
  * Zoom the map window so that all data of interest can be seen on the map.
  * Right click on the map window and choose `Select Items on Map`.
  * Follow the instructions displayed and select whatever data you want to have in one project.
  * When the selection is finished, click `Copy all selected items to a project` icon.
  * Select or create the destination project.
  * Remove all unnecessary projects from the workspace.

If you use a database you do not have to load all data of a project.
You can load only the items needed. Additionally, if you store a newly created
project into the database you do not need to clone (duplicate) the data.

In the same way all the contents of one project can be dragged into another project. 


## Copy project

To move a project from the workspace into a group in a database and keep the workspace project name proceed as follows:

* Right click on the project folder in the workspace and select `Copy to...` 
* Enter the name you want it to have in the database
* Select the destination database and in the next dialog the location in the database
