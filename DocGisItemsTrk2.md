A track is a list of points recorded while moving along. Tracks are also created artificially to be used for navigation and planning.

If you click on the highlighted track you get a short on-screen-summary and a few options:

![maproom1.png](images/DocGisItemsTrk/EditDetails.png) Show details of the track and edit data attached to the track. 

![maproom1.png](images/DocGisItemsTrk/Copy.png) Copy the track into another project.

![maproom1.png](images/DocGisItemsTrk/DeleteOne.png) Delete the track.

![maproom1.png](images/DocGisItemsTrk/TrkProfile.png) Highlight the track and show the on-screen track profile. Btw. did you know that the key combination "ctrl+e" will make the profile a sizable and movable widget? Use the same key combination to switch back.

![maproom1.png](images/DocGisItemsTrk/SelectRange.png) Select a range of track points for information about that range and some additional functions (hide, show, activity, copy)

![maproom1.png](images/DocGisItemsTrk/Reverse.png) Create a reversed copy of the track.

![maproom1.png](images/DocGisItemsTrk/Combine.png) Combine this track with other tracks in the project

![maproom1.png](images/DocGisItemsTrk/TrkCut.png) Cut the track at the selected point. You can use that to delete points at the start or the end of the track. Or to split a track into stages.
