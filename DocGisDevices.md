# Working with GPS Devices

QMapShack supports data exchange with several GPS outdoor units. All newer Garmin devices accessible with mass strorage mode will work. An the devices from CompeGPS are planned to be supported.

**Linux:** Make sure you have installed the UDisks2 package.  
**Windows:** No support unless someone donates the code to detect devices. 

After you pluged your device to the PC and switched it to mass stroage mode you should see something link this:
