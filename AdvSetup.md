# Overview of setup and configuration options

_Valid from patch version 55d8aa7 (18.11.2017)._

This page gives an overview over the available QMS GUI setup and configuration options. This includes in some cases QMS installation topics, too.

More details of the topics mentioned on this page can be found elsewhere in this [Wiki](DocMain).

## General options

### Workspace setup 

* Goto menu  `Workspace - Setup workspace`

  In the pop-up windows define
  
  * a time interval for automatic project data backup,
  * a listening port for a QMS multi-user environment.
* To control the visibility of parts of the workspace goto menu `Window`
    * `Toggle docks:` change visibility of all docked window parts at once.
    * `Toolbar:` change visibility of toolbar.
    * `Maps, Dig.Elev.Model (DEM), Workspace, Database, Routing:` change visibility of single docked window part.
    
### Waypoint icons setup

* Goto menu  `Workspace - Setup waypoint icons`
* In the pop-up windows click the `Open` icon and define a path from which additional user-defined waypoint icons can be loaded


### Toolbar setup

The toolbar allows quick access to important QMS actions.

* Toggle the display of the toolbar with the help of the menu `Window - Toolbar`.
* Configure the toolbar with the help of the menu `Window - Setup toolbar`:
    * Move actions to be included in the toolbar from the left part of the pop-up window to the right part of the window.
    * Move actions not to be included in the toolbar from the right part of the pop-up window to the left of the window.
    * Select the checkbox, if the toolbar should be displayed in the fullscreen mode, too.

## Map and DEM setup

### Download and install 

QMS can render vector maps in the Garmin format and various types of raster and online maps.

* _Vector maps:_ 
    * must have the `gmapsupp.img` container format,
    * only unlocked ones can be used,
    * typical sources:
        * [http://download.freizeitkarte-osm.de/garmin/latest](http://download.freizeitkarte-osm.de/garmin/latest) - select region and correct format.
        * [http://raumbezug.eu/osm-garmin_en.htm](http://raumbezug.eu/osm-garmin_en.htm) - select region and format.
        * an overview of available free vector maps can be found [here](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_Map_On_Garmin/Download).
    * download (and unzip if necessary) the map and save it in some map directory.
* _Raster maps:_ for details see [here](DocFaqMaps).
* _Online maps:_ 
    * [Load file with links to on-line maps](http://www.mtb-touring.net/qms/onlinekarten-einbinden/ "On-line maps"). 
      _Hint:_ Click field `Download online maps`! Result is a downloaded file `Onlinemaps.zip`. 
    * Unpack this file into some map directory.  
    
QMS can use digital elevation data (`DEM` data). Necessary files can be downloaded from

* [https://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/SRTM3](https://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/SRTM3) or
* [http://viewfinderpanoramas.org/dem3.html](http://viewfinderpanoramas.org/dem3.html).

For more details about the installation of maps and DEM data compare also the [Quick start guide](DocQuickStartEnglish).
