# Planning a Route #
# Quick start Routing #

Activate a proper map. OpenStreetMap as installed by "I want maps" will do perfectly.

Activate **Menue -> Project -> Add empty project**

and give it a proper name. Leave qms project type unless you know why not.

Activate **Menue -> Project -> Search Google** if not yet open.

Type some search term for your adress into the Google Project Field. You may activate the left triangle to see your results. If you get "Error:", try to change or refine your search term. Usually, a road and a town should give reasonable results. Right click on your result, activate "copy to" and select your project name given in the first step. If your search yields multiple results, only add the one desired.

This way, you collect **waypoints** in your project.
Repeat the steps for all waypoints your route is desired to pass.

Use **shift-<click>** or **ctrl-<click>** to solect some or all of your waypoints in the project. Be sure to select at least two waypoints and no other objects.
In the context menue (right mouse button), select "Create Route".

You can now adjust the sequence in which the route should pass your waypoints.

Continue with OK, enter a route name in the next window and select your project in the following window.

QMapShack automagically will calculate the route according to your current routing prefrences, which more or less may take some time.

Double click your route to zoom your map view to the whole route.

Click on the route between the waypoints to display route properties

Save your project if you want to use the results later.
