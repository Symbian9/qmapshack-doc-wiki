#Developers Welcome!

This project needs your help. Over the last 8 years the QLandkarte project grew very large. It's an incredible pile of source code and functionality. And that stuff wants to be ported to MapRoom. I do not intend to port everything. But still it will be a big task. 

And over the years I learned my limits. You can't be good at every topic. And as writing GIS software is not my profession at all, I am not good at many things I do here. 

I started to add issues to the issue tracker. No, I do not want you to fix my bugs. Watch out for issues of type "task". These are topics that need someone to implement and maintain. Have a look at the [list](https://bitbucket.org/maproom/maproom/issues?status=new&status=open). Perhaps one of the topics triggers your interest.
